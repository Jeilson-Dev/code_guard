# Code Guard

Code Guard is an essential tool for developers aiming to maintain the quality and organization of their software projects.

This software automatically scans the source code for comments containing the terms "check", "todo", or "fix".

By identifying these terms, Code Guard generates detailed reports that help developers track and manage pending tasks, quality checks, and necessary fixes.

With Code Guard, code maintenance becomes more efficient and effective, ensuring that no important task is overlooked.
